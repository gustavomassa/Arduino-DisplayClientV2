2018/09/07 DC v1.2.7
- Colorduino.h - Remove all the inefficient digitalPinToBitMask() and digitalPinToPort(), 
  which was causing the sketch to run very slow if compiled by later versions of Arduino.
- Colorduino.cpp - Disable interrupts inside SetWhiteBal(), so the timer ISR canâ€™t
  come in at the same time, it will screw up the control signal timing.
- Add a function to change the interrupt timer counter
- Origin (0,0) is bottom left corner. When we update the LED driver in run(), channel 23 is 
  the last shift register so we should start with column 7B-7G-7R... and ...1B-1G-1R last
  You can use the REVERSE_ROWCHANNELS define to flip the columns.
